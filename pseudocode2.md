NEED TO ADJUST LEVEL UP FUNCTION
LOOK AT ITERATION 2

### pseudocode for second iteration
--- create Fighter class
    --- add five to hitpoints(to the base level)
    ----adjusts the level_up function to add 10 hitpoints
    --- add one to dice roll(attack)
    --- add two to armor class 

    
--- create Rogue Class
    --- attack: if roll = 20, then 3 * attack(CRITICAL HIT)*
    --- add dexterity modifier to attack instead of strength*
    --- if alignment = good, change to bad or neutral*
    --- if dexterity is positive ignore dex-modifier armor_class - dexterity(REVISIT LATER) 

--- create Monk class
    --- add 1 hitpoint to base*
    --- 3 points of damage instead of 1*
    ----adjust the level_up function to add 6 hitpoints*
    --- add wisdom and dex modifier (if positive) to AC*

--- create Paladin class
    --- add 3 hitpoints to base*
    ---- adjust level_up function to at 8 per level*
    --- add +2 to dice_roll and attack if alignment = evil
    --- increases dice roll  by 1 for every level
    --- auto set align to good
